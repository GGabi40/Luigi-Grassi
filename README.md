<p>This is a landing page that aims to gain new knowledge and fix information already learned. We can see that it is an Italian restaurant and the functionality of the site includes showing its main dishes, the menu and a form for a reservation.</p>
<p>Doind this project I learned how to display a PopUp window and retained much of my knowledge of landing pages.</p>
